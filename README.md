# License Plate Detection
This project is done as a Final Year Project required to complete a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering. The code is based on Adrian Rosebrock's (@jrosebr1) PyImageSearch post [**OpenCV: Automatic License/Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with Python**](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/09/21/opencv-automatic-license-number-plate-recognition-anpr-with-python/), edited to be able to detect Malaysian license plates which typically has white texts on black background plate. I recommend reading through his blogpost to get a general idea of how the image processing pipeline works.

The project aims to:
* Automatically detects either Malaysian license plates or other oversea license plates
* Compare Scharr operator, Canny edge detector, and edge-less approach to detect license plates

## Prerequisites
The project code utilizes the following library:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) v3.8.6
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) v4.4.0.46
* [imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) v0.5.3
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) v0.17.2
* [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) v0.3.6
* [Tesseract-OCR](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/) v5.0.0 (alpha). (This is NOT installed through pip but with the Windows installer)

## How it works
1. The project has 2 modules which is the driver and the class module named **anprdriver.py** and **anprclass.py** respectively. The driver module contains the script which the user should execute through Python while providing the arguments whereas the class module contains the three detection algorithm (Sobel, Canny, and edge-less) and other functions including saving results and workflow debug display.
2. The driver should be executed in a terminal by using Python (`$ python anprdriver.py ...`). The arguments which could be appended are (arguments in bold are required):
   - **`-i` (input)** - path to input directory of images
   - `-c` (clear border) - should the script clear border pixels before performing OCR (default is -1, set to 1 to enable)
   - `-p` (PSM) - default tesseract page segmentation mode for license plate OCR (default is 7)
   - `-d` (debug) - should additional visualizations be shown (default is -1, set to 1 to enable)
   - `-a` (algorithm) - specify which algorithm to use (default is 1, 1 for Scharr, 2 for Canny, 3 for edge-less)
   - `-s` (save) - whether to save the results or not (default is -1, *disable debug* and set to 1 to enable)
   - `-m` (morphology) - specify morphological operation (default is 1, 1 for black hat which is better for black text on white plates, 2 for top hat which is better for the opposite)
3. The repository includes sample images of license plates in `malaysian` and `overseas` folder. Results are saved inside `result_canny_*`, `result_sobel_*`, and `result_edgeless_*` folders respectively where `*` is either `malaysian` or `overseas`.

## Typical usage
The script can be typically run by typing `python anprdriver.py -i /path/to/images/`. Path to the images can be written as `-i ./malaysian` for example. While only -i argument is necessary, be sure to choose the correct algorithm (-a) and morphological operation (-m) as needed.
